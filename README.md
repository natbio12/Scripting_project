#### Scripting project for BIOL7180 (spring 2020)
### Group Members: Md Jahangir Alam, Ulku Huma Altindag, Basu Kafle and Natalia Rivera Rincon

The aim of this project is to analyze bacterial genomes using state-of-the-arts toolsets.

Here is the main steps of the pipeline:

Step 1: Download 10 Bacillus draft genome sequences from NCBI database.: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/browse#!/prokaryotes/
Filtering options: Kingdom: Bacteria, Group: Terrabacteria group, Subgroup: Firmicutes, Assembly level: Contig,
RefSeq category: representative, Find Bacillus genome sequences.

Step 2: Predict 16S rRNA sequence using Barrnap, then identify genome species by BLASTing predicted 16S rRNA against 16S Microbial RefSeq database.
GitHub Link: https://github.com/mza0150/barrnap
Instructions: use/run the following scripts: installing barrnap: install_barrnap_script.sh, running barrnap: run_barrnap_script.sh

Step 3: Use Quast to find key features (e.g., #bp, #N50, #L50, #contigs etc) of all genomes
GitHub Link: http://quast.sourceforge.net/docs/manual.html
Instructions: genomes_statistics_quast.sh

Step 4: Use prokka to annotate genomes.
GitHub Link: https://github.com/tseemann/prokka

Step 5: Use antiSMASH to identify biosynthetic gene clusters(BGCs) in all genomes.
Link: https://docs.antismash.secondarymetabolites.org/
Instructions: use/run the following scripts: use install antiSMASH: install_antiSMASH.sh, run antiSMASH: run_antiSMASH.sh

Step 6: Identify extent of Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT).

Step 7: Identify homology of a specific gene of interest (e.g., P450).
We are going to use rpsblast, and we need the raw data we had from the first step as a data base and the query that is going to be the output of the genome anottation in step. 
After you have the necessary input you need to run the next command

rpsblast -db database_name -query input_file -out output_file -num_descriptions 20 -num_alignments 20
